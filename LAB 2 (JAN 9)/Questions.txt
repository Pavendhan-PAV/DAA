1.

Input:   Integer Array A and an integer p
Question: Does there exist q and r in A such that p=q+r

Propose three different logic and implement all three.   Use system time function and compare system time for each logic.   Test drive on at least 20 different inputs and plot the graph.    Is it possible to call 'excel' from C/C++ program to plot the graph.   If yes, make an attempt.   Identify which logic is efficient through system time.



2.

Input:   Accept a large sized integer array from the user with the following constraints  (i) user should not enter the size of the array  (ii) the elements must be entered in non-decreasing order  until some time after which the user must enter -1 only and no other integer.

Question:  Identify the position of the first '-1'

Propose three different logic and implement all three.  Like the above, compare system time to pick the best.    As a programmer, you may declare an array of size, say, 10000.
