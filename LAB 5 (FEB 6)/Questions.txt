1. Input:   Sorted Arrays; A1,...Ak    Question:  Sort union of A_i 's

Implement the following Logic

L1:  Incremental Design   ;  Sort(A_1,A_2), A_3), A_4,...

L2: Divide and Conquer  ;   Split k arrays into two sets of k/2 each.   Let this be done recursively until set size is 2.   Invoke Sort function in a bottom up fashion.

L3: Maintain k pointers,   Find MIN out of k elements pointed by the pointers and output MIN.  If MIN is in A_i, then move pointer P_i by one cell right.   Continue this process until all elements are visited.

L4: Construct BST on union of A_i 's and perform inorder traversal.

L5: Maintain a heap on k elements pointed by k pointers,  then extract MIN,  If MIN is in A_i, then move pointer P_i by one cell right.  Insert the current element pointed by P_i into Min-heap, continue this process

2. SORTING

a. Create  a random integer array of size 10^6.
b. Follow divide and conquer strategy (Merge Sort) until the input size is reduced to 10^4.   Recursion bottoms out at this input size.   All leaves of the input reduction tree are approximately 10^4.
c. Perform Insertion sort at each leaf node
d. In a bottom up fashion combine the solutions using Merge Sort MERGE routine.
